# Base Premium Depending on Automotive Data 
 A base premium calculation is processed depending on an automative dataset. 
First, the frequency of the person involved causing the accident was modeled. Secondly, a model of accident severity was created. Based on these models, the base premium was calculated and visualized in Streamlit. Streamlit currently calculates the base premium with the information it receives from the user.
